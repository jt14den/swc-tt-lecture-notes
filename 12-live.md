**cornerstones**

* One of the cornerstones of Software and Data Carpentry teaching is live coding:
    * instructors don't use slides, but work through the lesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with workshop participants following along
* **This Section** explains how it works, why we use it, and provides general tips.

## Why live coding?

> Teaching is theater not cinema.
> -- Neal Davis

* We do not use slides in our lessons.
* Instead instructors plug their laptop into the projector and work through the lesson script, typing code, reformatting data and talking as we go.

>##Up and down
>What do you think some **advantages and challenges** of live coding are from both a learner's and an instructors point of view? (5min)
{: .discussion}

**It's advantages are:**

* Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching someone toggle through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
* It enables instructors to be more responsive to "what if?" questions. **slide decks** can be like a **railway track**, while live coding allows instructors to got **off road**  and follow learner's interests
* It facilitates **lateral knowledge transfer**: people learn more than we realize we were teaching by watching how instructors do things -- **think about how you learned to drive?** watching
* It **slows the instructor down**: if she has to type in the program as she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners, rather than 10-fold faster with slides.
* Learners get to see the instructor make mistakes and ***how to diagnose and correct them.*** Novices are going to spend **a lot** of time doing this, but it's left out of most textbooks!

**There's practice involved for an instructor to get used to live coding and thinking out loud in front of an audience**, but most report that it is no more difficult to do than talking with a slide deck.

Many instructors use two devices when teaching
: a laptop plugged into the projector for learners and a tablet beside it on which they can view their notes/etherpad session.

* NOTE: **live coding** is an example of the "I/WE/YOU" approach to teaching from earlier.

>## Bad and the good
>Watch this video of [live coding done poorly](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE) and this video of [live coding done right](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY) as a group and then summarize your feedback on both in the Etherpad. Use the two x two rubric for feedback we discussed earlier.
In the videos, the bash shell `for` loop is taught, and it is assumed learners are familiar with how to use a variable, the `head` command and the content of the `basilisk.dat unicorn.dat` files.

>Note: Sometime sounds in the room can be poor. Turning on closed captioning by pressing the cc button will improve the accessibility of these videos.

>This exercise should take about 15 minutes.

## Live Coding Top 10

Here're are some tips to help you get started with live coding:

### 1. Be Seen and Heard

* If you can stand for a couple of hours, do it when teaching.

### 2. Take it slow


### 3. Mirror your learner's environment as much as possible

### 4. Use the screen wisely

### 5. Use illustrations

### 6. Avoid being disturbed

### 7. Stick to the lesson material


### 8. Leave no learner behind

### 9. Embrace mistakes

### 10. Have fun
