### key points

* Novices: don’t know what they don’t know.
* Competent practitioners: have a usable mental model that’s good enough for everyday purposes.
* Expert: can handle edge cases.
* Goal when teaching novices is to help them construct a usable mental model.
* To do this, must clear up their misconceptions.
* Summative assessment: done at the end of teaching to see whether learning took place.
* Formative assessment: done during teaching to guide learning.
* Can use multiple choice questions (MCQs) as formative assessments to diagnose misconceptions.

* Let's get started by learning some theory, how it relates to SWC and putting the theory into practice.

### Cognitive Development & Mental Models

* Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of mental models of a domain
* What do we mean by mental model?
  * One example: many of us learned that the ball-and-spring model of  molecules
  * molecules aren't balls and springs; their bonds not springs
  * but the model does a good job of helping people reason about molecules, chemical compounds and their reactions

>### Your mental models
>In the Etherpad, write your primary research domain or area of expertise and one mental model you use to frame and understand your work? This discussion should take about 5 minutes.
>> Me - Work in the library provide data services - help researchers and students with their research, provide instructions on tools that make them more productive

* one way to think about the difference b/t **novice and "competent practicioner"** is the existence of the **big picture** mental model
  * See: Brenner, who applied the [Dreyfus model of skill aquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) in studies on how nurses progress from novice -> expert
* This model has three stages:
  1. **novice** is someone who doesn't know what they don't know
    * has not built a mental model of a domain or how elements of the domain relate
    * often reason by analogy and guesswork, misapply other parts of other domains to the new one
    * signature of novice is their questions **aren't even wrong**
  2. **competent practicioner** has a mental model good enough for everyday purposes: Not completely accurate, but useful
    * e.g. average drivers mental model of a working car typically doesn't include the complexity of what a mechanic knows
    * can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances
  3. **expert** can easily handle situations that are nonnormative (out)
