* Our final topic in educational psychology, we'll be learning about human memory -- specifically how to remove unnecessary 'load' in order to facilitate learning.
*
## Types of Memory
* For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different categories
  - Long-term or persistent memory - where we store things like our bank card pins, passwords and home address
  - It's unbounded (baring injury or disease)
* A second memory system we possess is called *short-term* or *working memory*
  - You use this memory to actively thing about things
  - It is much faster but smaller
  - In 1956 George Miller estimated that the average adult's working memory could hold [7±2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)
  - this is why phone numbers have a limit of typically 7 or 8 digits
  - back when phones had dials not touchpads, that was the longest string of numbers most adults could remember accurately for as long as it took to dial to go round and round.
* more recent studies suggest working memory is actually even smaller
* This has important implications for teaching
  - if we present our learners with lots of info without opportuntiy to practice using it, they won't retain it
  - however if we present small amounts of info interspersed with practice opportunities, more like to retain
  - this is why frequent formative assessment is important

>## Testing your working memory
>I'm going to read a list of items and want you to try and memorize the items in it:
>cat, apple, ball, tree, square, head, house, door, box, car, king, hammer, milk, fish, book, tape, arrow, flower, key, shoe
>In the etherpad, write down as many words from the list as you can. Compare to other members of the group. What words are remembered the most?

* most ppl have found they only remember 5-7 words
* don't worry if you remember less - amny factors influence working Memory
* there are techniques to improve working membor

## Strategies For Memory Management
* Our minds store larger number of facts in short-term memory by creating **chunks** -- or relationship among separate items
  - causing them to be remembered together
  -(whiteboard) e.g. most will remember a word we read as "cat", rather than "c-a-t"
  - similarly 5 spots on cards or die is remember together rather than in pieces

>## Improving short term memory with chunking
> Repeat the memory exercise you did earlier, but this time, try to form short stories or phrases, or a visual image, from the words you see.
>
>Write the number of words you remembered in the Etherpad. How does this compare with your first attempt?

> I'm going to read a list of items and want you to try and memorize the items in it:

* storing in groups reduces the number of effective items in your workingmemory
* this is one of the reasons why helping our learners see connections between things is v. important

## Formative Assessment
* a key component in helping learners solidify their understanding and transfer ideas from short-term memory into long-term memory.
* needs to be frequent, to consolidate new concepts into long-term memor b/f working memory "fills" up
* helpful in lesson planning - identify when and where to add Formative assessment.

## Concept Maps as Instructional Planning Tools

A TOOL of choice to represent an expert's knowledge graph is the

***concept map***.
: is simply a picture of someone's mental model of a domain - facts are bubbles, and connections are labelled arcs

* It's important that the arcs are labelled:  saying "X and Y are related" is only helpful if we explain what the relationship is.
  * YES, one person's fact may be another's connection, but by *externalizing cognition* (making these model's visable), concept maps help spark and focus discussion
* let's draw one based on a for loop -- don't worry if you don't don't fully understand this

* Three key concepts are:
 ![loop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/for-loop-concepts.png)

*The key relationships, which are as important as the concepts themselves, are:

![loop2](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/for-loop-arcs.png)

* a quick count shows there are 6 things here, not just there 5 things here, not 3, so we are already brushing against limits of short-term Memory
* this is around the right size for teaching an episode
* if it grows in concepts it should be broken into multiple graphs and developed

* many concept maps can be larger than the recommended limit (7+-2), but that's not a bad thing [Set and Dict example](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/fig/dict-set.png)
* after drawing a concept map for an entire subject, the lesson designer can carve out a tightly-connected sub-graphs to make individual episodes

>##(EXERCISE) Concept mapping (<https://goo.gl/279azG>)
>Create a hand drawn concept map for something you would teach in five minutes. (Possibly for the same subject that you used to create a multiple choice question before.) Trade with a partner, and critique each other’s maps. Do they present concepts or surface detail? Which of the relationships in your partner’s map do you consider concepts and vice versa?

>Take 10 minutes to draw the concept maps and share with your neighbor. Write done in the chat once you have finished.
> ASk how it went?

**Concept maps can be used in many ways:**

1. To aid **solo design** of a lesson by helping authors **figure out what they're trying to teach**. Crucially a concept map **separates content from order**: in our experience ppl rarely wind up teaching things in order in which they first drew them
2. They aid in communication with other lesson designers. Instructors with different ideas often pull their learners in different directions.
3. Concept maps **help learners**. When possible give learners a pre-drawn map at the beginning of a lesson for them to annotate, it's better to draw piece by piece while teaching to reinforce the ties between what's in the map and what the instructor said.
4. Concept maps are also useful **formative assessment tool**: have learners draw concept maps of what they think they just heard shows the instructor what was missed and what was mis-understood. often too long in time for swc workshops

## Why Guided Practice is Important

* we use **guided practice** in the carpentries
  - we set up structure and exercies where learners can test their skills & get feedback on progress
* this contrasts with another teaching strategy known as **constructivist**, **discovery**, **problem-based**, **experiential** or **inquiry-based** learning
* In 2006, these types of approaches were the subject of a paper titled "Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching”.
* min-guidance approaches ignore what we know about human cognitive architecture & evidence from many research studies
* minimally guided instruction reuqires learners to simultaneously master a **domain's factual content** and its **search and problem solving strategies**.
* And although fostering creativity and independence is intuitively alluring, it doesn't mean that it works

* Sweller (a co-author on the paper) proposed an alternative based on the theory of **[cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load)**
  * this theory posits:
    1. **intrinsic load** is what they (learners) have to keep in mind in order to carry out a learning task
    2. **germane load** is (the desirable) mental effort required to create linkages between new information coming in and old information we already have (**germane load** is one of the things that distinguishes learning from **rote memorization**)
    3. **extraneous load** is everything else that distracts or gets in the way

**With this said, however, some predictions *can* be made:**

*  [split-attention effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_attention_effect)
  * Linguistic and visual input are processed by different parts of the human brain, and linguistic and visual memories are stored separately too.
  * this means that correlating **different linguistic, auditory and visual streams of info takes cognitive work**:
      * when someone reads one thing while hearing something else spoken aloud, their brain can't help but check that it's getting the same info in both channels
  * differences between these channels increase cognitive load and stymie or decelerates learning
  * **THEREFORE** learning is more effective when information that is being presented simultaneously in different channels is the same
  * **for our workshops** this means the instructor should say out loud commands as they type them on the screen during live coding.

## Faded Examples

* Per **cognitive load theory**, searching for a solution strategy can be an extra burden on top of applying that strategy
* we can therefore accelerate learning by giving learners **worked examples** that show them a problem and a detailed **step-by-step solution**, followed by a series of ***faded examples***
* the first example presents a nearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy just demonstrated with a small number of blanks for the learner to fill in
* the next problem is also of the same type, but has more blanks, and *so on* until the learner is asked to solve the entire problem.

* **faded examples** work because they introduce the **problem-solving** strategy piece by piece
* each step learners have one new problem to tackle
* this is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of paper
* it encourages learners to think about similarities and differences between various approaches, which helps create linkages in the mental model that is trying to be relayed

* For example, someone teaching in Python start by explaining this:

```python
#total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
def total_length(words):
  total = 0
  for word in words:
    total += len(word)
  return total
```

* then **ask** learners to fill in the blanks in this:

```python
# word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
def word_lengths(words):
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths
```
Another step of fading might be this:

```python
# concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
def concatenate_all(words):
    result = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return result
```

and finally learners would be asked to do:

```python
# acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
def acronymize(words):
    ____
```

* When using faded examples:
    * it's key to think about the **problem-solving strategy or solution pattern** that is meant to be taught
    * the example above is illustrating the ***accumulator pattern*** in which the results of **processing items in a collection** are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way to create the final result

>##Create a Faded Example from a Lesson
>The following exercise should be done in groups of 2-3.

>Pick a block of code from an existing Software or Data Carpentry lesson, or from another lesson you have taught recently.
>Replace 2-3 pieces of the code with a blank.
>Write a question to test the student’s ability to correctly fill in that blank.
>Take 10 minutes for this exercise.
>Paste your faded example in the Etherpad.
