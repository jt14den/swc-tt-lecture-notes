## What does it take to write lessons?


A theme we've covered so far:

* to write MCQs we work from students misconceptions and write questions to figure out those misconceptions
* to write faded examples we start with a whole example and take away
pieces
* so to write a lesson we want to start at knowing our audience and what we want them to learn, then develop your lesson from that knowledge.

## profiles

-   Know thy learners
-   often the hosts will have a specific audience in mind
-   a creative way to typify the audience for a course is by using
    *learner profiles*
-   borrowed from user interface design where users stories help inform
    UI designers on what users need to accomplish on a system
-   *learner profiles* have 3 parts: general background, the problem
    they face, and how the course will help them

## Learner Profiles exercise

Read Software Carpentry’s learner profiles and then write one that
describes a fictional colleague of your own. Who are they, what problems
do they face, and how will this training help them? Be as specific as
possible. Enter your learner profile into the Gdocs.

This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

## Learning Objectives
* Once you have an idea of your intended audience, the next step is to set goals for your course or workshop.
* These goals will be infomed by your audience and will communicate to them and to yourself what you should focus on during the course.
* These goals are usually communicated through **learning objectives**.
-   **learning objects** are a single sentence describing what a learner
    will be able to do after the lesson or episode.

not fuzzy
---------

-   learning objects shouldn't be fuzzy things or broad statements like
    'understand git' or 'code in python'
-   need to be specific goals like:
    -   learners can revert a change to a file using git
    -   leaners will name three benefit of using a version control
        system like git
    -   learners will compare the collaboration features of git an
        dropbox
-   specific, verifiable descriptions of what learners need to do to
    demonstrate their learning
-   should have a measurable or verifiable verb (name, locate, apply,
    critize)
-   should specify the criteria for acceptable performance
-   writing these might seem restrictive, but if done well you'll end up
    with clear guidelines for your teaching and assessment and learners
    will appreicate clear expectations
-   to aid in developing your learning objectives and classify the types
    of learning taking place use a taxonomy like Bloom's taxonomy( e.g.
    knowledge(recalling), comprehension, application, analysis,
    synthesis, evaluation). There's a table in the lessons that list
    Bloom's taxonomy and also lists 'learning objective' verbs.

>Your instructor has posted links to a handful of current Software and Data Carpentry lessons in the Etherpad. Select one learning objective from one of those lessons, then complete the following steps to evaluate it.
* Unix shell - http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice
* Git - http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice
* Data Carpentry Spreadsheet http://datacarpentry.github.io/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/
* Open Refine Ecology http://datacarpentry.github.io/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/
* Intro to data (library carpentry): https://data-lessons.github.io/library-data-intro/
* library carpentry open refine https://data-lessons.github.io/library-openrefine/

>Identify the learning objective verb. How specifically does this verb describe the desired learner outcome?
>In your opinion, does the lesson do an effective job of meeting the stated objective?
>Does the lesson meet any objectives that are not stated in the objectives section?
>This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
>10min

* any thoughts on on learning objectives. comments? i know we have
some people with education backgrounds in the class? any tips for
writing learning commons?*

 * learning objectives help communicate to your learners what
they'll be able to do after attending the workshop. They should be
specific and verifiable. You can use existing taxonomies like bloom's to
categorize the kinds of learning you are going for.


## Software and Data Carpentry Lessons

<https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>

-   It would be idea if all the SWC lessons were written in a reverse
    instructional design method, but that's not the case.
-   One thing that's true is that the lessons are continually improved
    by the software carpentry community.
-   let's take a look at the lessons - I'm going to share the screen
    Here

Software Carpentry Software Carpentry’s most commonly used lessons are:

-   The Unix Shell
-   Version Control with Git
-   Programming with Python
-   Programming with R and
-   R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis

A SWC workshop typically is one of the programming lessons and unix and
git.

We also have lesson on:

-   Version Control with Mercurial
-   Using Databases and SQL
-   Programming with MATLAB and
-   Automation and Make

**but these are less frequently used.**

Data Carpentry
--------------

<http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/>

-   Lessons are domain-specific
-   cover data management and viz skills in taht domain-specific

-   Domains included are:

-   Ecology
-   Genomics
-   Geospatial

-   more information about each lesson, including instructor notes,
    reference information is available at the lesson website.

-   Any questions about data and Carpentry lessons?

Summary
-------

In this episode we covered:

* How to write learner profiles to clarify audience for a lesson and Communicate lesson goals by writing specific, verifiable learning objectives.
* we touched on the technique of using reverse instructional design to create lessons: concepts, summative assessment, formative assessments, teachings.
* We introduced Software Carpentry’s lessons and that they typicall cover the Unix shell, version control, programming, SQL, and Make. \* We did the same for Data Carpentry’s lessons and that they cover data cleanup, management,
analysis, and visualization in a variety of fields. previous episode

-   any questions or comments for this episode? Can you imagine using
    any of the lesson development techniques?
