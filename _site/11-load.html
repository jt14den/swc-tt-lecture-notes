  <li>Our final topic in educational psychology, we’ll be learning about human memory – specifically how to remove unnecessary ‘load’ in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="battling-theories">Battling Theories</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In 2006, Kirschner, Sweller and Clark published a paper titled “Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching”.</li>
  <li>They say (<strong>READ</strong>):</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are very popular and intuitively appealing … these approaches ignore both the structures that constitute <strong>human cognitive architecture</strong> and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that consistently indicate that <strong>minimally guided instruction</strong> is less effective and less efficient than instructional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning process. The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide “internal” guidance.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>This paper set off a minor academic kerfuffle:
    <ul>
      <li>Mainly b/c the authors were claiming <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning">inquiry-based learning</a></strong> (sometimes also called <strong>Problem-based learning</strong>)– allowing learners to ask their own questions, set their own goals, and find their own paths thru subjects – doesn’t work very well.</li>
      <li>Kirshcher and authors’ argument was that learners need to simultaneously master a <strong>domain’s factual content</strong> and its <strong>search and problem solving strategies</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        <p>And although fostering creativity and independence is intuitively alluring, it doesn’t mean that it works</p>
      </li>
      <li>Sweller (a co-author on the paper - <em>Why minimal guidance during instruction doesn’t work</em>) proposed an alternative based on the theory of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">cognitive load</a></strong></li>
      <li>this theory postulates:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>intrinsic load</strong> is what they (learners) have to keep in mind in order to carry out a learning task</li>
          <li><strong>germane load</strong> is (the desirable) mental effort required to create linkages between new information coming in and old information we already have (<strong>germane load</strong> is one of the things that distinguishes learning from <strong>rote memorization</strong>)</li>
          <li><strong>extraneous load</strong> is everything else that distracts or gets in the way</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>cognitive load theory’s</strong> proponents claim that eliminating extraneous cognitive load accelerates learning
        <ul>
          <li>it also has <a href="https://edtechdev.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/cognitive-load-theory-failure/">been criticized</a>, most particularly for being unfalsifiable or un-confirmable.</li>
          <li>critics say that since there’s no way to tell in advance of an experiment whether something is <strong>germane or not</strong>, any result can be justified after the fact just by labelling what hurt performance as “extraneous” and things that don’t (or enhance/enable) as “germane”.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>With this said, however, some predictions <em>can</em> be made:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>One example is Moreno and Mayer’s work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_attention_effect">split-attention effect</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Linguistic and visual input are processed by different parts of the human brain, and linguistic and visual memories are stored separately too.</li>
      <li>this means that correlating <strong>different linguistic, auditory and visual streams of info takes cognitive work</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>when someone reads one thing while hearing something else spoken aloud, their brain can’t help but check that it’s getting the same info in both channels</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>differences between these channels increase cognitive load and stymie or decelerates learning</li>
      <li><strong>THEREFORE</strong> learning is more effective when information that is being presented simultaneously in different channels is the same</li>
      <li><strong>for our workshops</strong> this means the instructor should say out loud commands as they type them on the screen during live coding.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faded-examples">Faded Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Per <strong>cognitive load theory</strong>, searching for a solution strategy can be an extra burden on top of applying that strategy</li>
  <li>we can therefore accelerate learning by giving learners <strong>worked examples</strong> that show them a problem and a detailed <strong>step-by-step solution</strong>, followed by a series of <strong><em>faded examples</em></strong></li>
  <li>the first example presents a nearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy just demonstrated with a small number of blanks for the learner to fill in</li>
  <li>
    <p>the next problem is also of the same type, but has more blanks, and <em>so on</em> until the learner is asked to solve the entire problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>faded examples</strong> work because they introduce the <strong>problem-solving</strong> strategy piece by piece</li>
  <li>each step learners have one new problem to tackle</li>
  <li>this is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of paper</li>
  <li>
    <p>it encourages learners to think about similarities and differences between various approaches, which helps create linkages in the mental model that is trying to be relayed</p>
  </li>
  <li>For example, someone teaching in Python start by explaining this:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) =&gt; 12</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">total_length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">words</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
  <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">word</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">total</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>then <strong>ask</strong> learners to fill in the blanks in this:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) =&gt; [3, 5, 4]</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">word_lengths</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">words</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">lengths</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">____</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">word</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">lengths</span> <span class="n">____</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">lengths</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Another step of fading might be this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) =&gt; "redgreenblue"</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">concatenate_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">words</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">____</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">____</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">____</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">____</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>and finally learners would be asked to do:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) =&gt; "RGB"</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">acronymize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">words</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">____</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>When using faded examples:
    <ul>
      <li>it’s key to think about the <strong>problem-solving strategy or solution pattern</strong> that is meant to be taught</li>
      <li>the example above is illustrating the <strong><em>accumulator pattern</em></strong> in which the results of <strong>processing items in a collection</strong> are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way to create the final result</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>##Create a Faded Example from a Lesson
The following exercise should be done in groups of 2-3.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pick a block of code from an existing Software or Data Carpentry lesson, or from another lesson you have taught recently.
Replace 2-3 pieces of the code with a blank.
Write a question to test the student’s ability to correctly fill in that blank.
Take 10 minutes for this exercise.
Paste your faded example in the Etherpad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="parson-problems">Parson Problems</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Another way to reduce cognitive load is using <strong>Parson Problems</strong></li>
  <li>In this case, learners are presented with jumbled parts of a solution and asked to put them in order</li>
  <li>Example: when learning a language students could be asked to order a set of words to create a grammatically correct response to a question</li>
  <li>Our learners can be given lines of the code needed to solve a problem and asked to arrange them.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Then learners can be told they have all the lines they need <strong>except one</strong> and so forth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Here’s a nice online Parson Problem interactive tool.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="parson-problems-1">Parson Problems</h2>
