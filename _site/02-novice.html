<h3 id="cognitive-development--mental-models">Cognitive Development &amp; Mental Models</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of mental models of a domain</li>
  <li>What do we mean by mental model?
    <ul>
      <li>One example: many of us learned that the ball-and-spring model of  molecules</li>
      <li>molecules aren’t balls; their bonds not springs</li>
      <li>but the model does a good job of helping people reason about molecules, chemical compounds and their reactions to one another</li>

<ul>
  <li>One way to think about the difference b/t <strong>novice and “competent practicioner”</strong> is the existence of the <strong>big picture</strong> mental model
    <ul>
      <li>See: Brenner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a> in studies on how nurses progress from novice -&gt; expert</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This model has three stages:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>novice</strong> is someone who doesn’t know what they don’t know
        <ul>
          <li>has not built a mental model of a domain or how elements of the domain relate</li>
          <li>often reason by analogy and guesswork, misapply other parts of other domains to the new one</li>
          <li>signature of novice is their questions <strong>aren’t even wrong</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>competent practicioner</strong> has a mental model good enough for everyday purposes: Not completely accurate, but useful
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. average drivers mental model of a working car typically doesn’t include the complexity of what a mechanic knows</li>
          <li>can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>expert</strong> can easily handle situations that are nonnormative</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>We assume most learners coming to SW/D/LC workshop are novices</strong> and do not have strong mental models for the concepts we teach</li>
  <li>Our <strong>primary goal</strong> is not to teach syntax of a particular programming language, but to teach people how to think about programming and data management
    <ul>
      <li>AND about using computers in research more generally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-go-slow---why-we-go-slowly">WHY GO SLOW - Why we go slowly</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The transition from novice to competent practitioners involves the construction of right (enough) categories:
    <ul>
      <li>building a new mental model of this new intellectual domain</li>
      <li>goal of education for novices is to help them form correct categories</li>
      <li><strong>until</strong> they’ve done that trying to load information on them confuses more than educates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="discussion">
  <h2 id="discussion-manual-v-tutorials">(Discussion) Manual v. Tutorials</h2>
  <p>Programming books are often categorized into <em>reference manuals</em> and <em>tutorials or guides</em>.
With that in mind, what do you think some of the differences between a manual and a tutorial in terms of novices and competent practitioners? Can one document do a good job of being both?</p>

  <p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>SEE also:</strong> https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/02-novice/#different-kinds-of-lessons</p>

<ul>
  <li>One reason software development is so frustrating</li>
  <li>Reference material is opaque to someone who doesn’t know what they don’t know (novice w/o a mental map).</li>
  <li>Likewise, tutorials that help build such a map are too slow and diffuse for people who already have one
    <ul>
      <li>it is poss. to make something that serves both groups, but often easier to address their needs separately</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think some implications of this might be for preparing to teach software carpentry?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>An example of the practical implications of this: our Unix lesson only introduces 12 commands and typically spends 2.5 hours to cover
    <ul>
      <li>12.5 minutes per command may seem very slow, but the lesson’s real purpose is to teach learners about paths, history, wildcards, pipes and filters, command-line arguments, redirection and the other big ideas the shell depends on (and without which ppl can’t understand how to use commands or read their manual pages).</li>
      <li>That model also includes:
        <ol>
          <li>DRY - anything you <strong>repeat manually</strong>, you’ll ultimately get wrong (so make the computer repeat things for you by using <strong>tab completion</strong> and the <strong>history command</strong>)</li>
          <li><strong>Lots of little tools</strong>, combined as needed, are more productive than a handful of “kitchen sink” programs (motivates the pipe-and-filter model and segues to functions)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These two examples illustrates something else as well.</li>
  <li>Learning consists of more than <strong>just</strong> building mental models &amp; pouring in information
    <ul>
      <li>THAT <strong>creating linkages between concepts</strong> and facts is as important</li>
      <li>Telling people not to repeat things, and they should think in terms of little pieces loosely joined
        <ul>
          <li>Both set the stage for <strong>introducing functions</strong></li>
          <li>Explicitly referring back to <strong>pipes and filters</strong> when introducing functions helps solidify both ideas</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-useful-mental-models">Building Useful Mental Models</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <strong>positive</strong> strategies for building mental models: analogies, stories, role-play, and diagrams are ways to represent a structure that can be used as a model</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>However</strong> there’s a greater challenges to creating mental models:</p>

</ul>

  <p>It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.
It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.<br />
— Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Clearing up <strong>learners misconceptions</strong> is as important as presenting them with correct information.</li>
  <li>Their misconceptions may fall into three categories:
    * Simple <strong>factual errors</strong>, such as believing that St. Louis is the capital of Missouri. These are simple to correct,
  but getting the facts right is not enough on its own.
    * <strong>Broken models</strong>, believing that motion and acceleration must be in the same direction. We can address these by having them reason through examples to see contradictions.
    * <strong>Fundamental beliefs</strong>, such as “the world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot be affecting the planet’s climate”. These usually cannot be addressed in class, since they are deeply connected to the learner’s social identity and often cannot be reasoned away.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any examples of “broken or misapplied models” you’d like to share? Do you remember how it got corrected?</p>

  <p>teaching R -&gt; Stata</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Since SW &amp; D Carpentry are focused on novices, and helping build strong mental models, we’re most interested in the middle category of misconceptions (broken models)</li>
  <li>During teaching, we want to <strong>expose broken models</strong> so that we can diagnose and provide better ones.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="discussion-what-happens-next">(Discussion) What Happens Next?</h2>

  <p>An example of how solving problems can help people correct broken mental models,
consider this problem from Epstein’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Physics-Understandable-Practical-Reality/dp/0935218084/r">Thinking Physics</a></em>.
Imagine that you have placed a cake of ice in a bathtub
and then filled the tub to the rim with water.
When the ice melts,
does the water level go up (so that the tub overflows),
go down,
or stay the same?
The correct answer is that it stays the same;
figuring out why helps people build a model of the relationship between weight, volume, and density.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-mental-models">Accessing mental models</h2>

<h3 id="ask-the-questions">ask the questions?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What do you think we can do to surface these misconceptions, especially in how they related to mental models.???</li>
  <li>How can we do this in-class and know whether learners already understand the topic? (so we can move forward)</li>
  <li>
    <p>and if not, what we need to address in their misconceptions?</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>we as instructors</strong> need feedback on learners’ progress and insight into their mental models</li>
  <li>This is usually done through two kinds of assessments:
    <ul>
      <li><em>summative assessment</em> is used to tell if the desired learning took place and whether the learner can move ahead
        <ul>
          <li>either fail for pass, e.g. driving exam that tells the rest of society whether someone can safely drive</li>
          <li>Other examples?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>formative assessment</em> takes place during teaching and learning
        <ul>
          <li>main purpose: to guide by telling both instructor and learner what to focus on</li>
          <li>not pass or fail</li>
          <li>e.g. a music teacher might ask a student to play a scale very slowly to see if she is breathing correctly and if not correct</li>
          <li>secondary purpose is to prepare learners for summative assessments: don’t test what wasn’t in the lesson</li>
          <li>any examples?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For us, we are <strong>mostly concerned</strong> with formative assessments</li>
  <li>This needs to quick to administer and evaluate</li>
  <li>Most widely employed is <strong>multiple choice questions (MCQs)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>if designed well these can do much more than measure how much someone knows</li>
      <li>e.g. supposed we are teaching children multi-digit addition</li>
      <li>a well designed MCQ could be:</li>

<ul>
  <li>if the majority of the class votes for a single wrong answer, you should go back and work on correcting that misconception</li>
  <li>if most vote for right answer, it’s probably safe to move on</li>
  <li>if answers are pretty evenly split between options, learners are probably randomly guessing and it’s good to go back to where everyone was on the same page</li>

<h3 id="tips-in-swc">TIPs in SWC</h3>

<ol>
  <li>instructors should use MCQs or some of the kind of formative assessment (coding challenge) at least every 10-15 min to insure the class is learning</li>
  <li>when you give an exercise in S/D/L carpentry, circle the room or have your helpers - use the sticky notes to find folks having difficulty - typically there’s a pattern – talk with your helpers, share</li>
  <li>formative assessments can also be used preemptively:</li>
  <li>if you start an episode or section with an MCQ and everyone gets it, you can skip the part of the lecture</li>
</ol>

  <h3 id="peer-instruction-skip-if-needed">Peer Instruction (SKIP if needed)</h3>

  <p>No matter how good a teacher is,
she can only say one thing at a time.
How then can she clear up many different misconceptions
in a reasonable time?</p>

  <p>Peer instruction is essentially a way to provide one-to-one mentorship in a scalable way.
Despite this,
we usually do not use it in our workshops because
it takes people time to learn a new way to learn—time
that we don’t have in our compressed two-day format.</p>
